# Ubiqum-Bookstore

Development of a bookstore website for Ubiqum Code Academy

DESCRIPTION

-Use of Vue.js as progressive framework for building the user interface.

-Access to books data hosted on a remote JSON without downloading it since the client can modify the content without modifying the structure.

-Books are displayed with a responsive behaviour that required adaptation with Flexbox.

-Deployment of search engine to filter for any field in the book. Whether it be title, description or any other.

-When doing HOVER on each of the covers, it rotates to show the title, the description and a “More Info” button. This button will take you to a more detailed image of the cover (not the same image) that is shown in a LIGHTBOX (popup/modal).


Technologies:

Vue.js, JSON, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Fancy-Box
